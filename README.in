2. Unzip into some directory
3. Open a command shell, cd to the directory that you placed the zip contents into
4. python setup.py install
   On the Mac, this places the fido.sh executable somewhere useful:
   sudo python setup.py install --install-scripts=/usr/local/bin
5. You should now be able to see the help text: 
   python -m fido.run -h
   If you are lucky, you may also be able to run with 
   fido.sh -h

Windows

   (or use the big Downloads button on http://github.com/openplanets/fido)
2. Double click
3. Open a comnand shell.  You should now be able to run fido:
   python -m fido.run -h

Dependencies
------------

Fido 0.7 and later will run on Python 2.6 or Python 2.7 with no other dependencies.

Format Definitions
------------------

By default, Fido loads format information from two files conf/formats.xml
and conf/format_extensions.xml. Addition format files can be specified using
the -loadformats command line argument.  They should use the same syntax as 
conf/format_extensions.xml. If more than one format file needs to be specified,
then they should be comma separated as with the -formats argument.

Output
------

Output is controlled with the two parameters matchprintf and nomatchprintf.
Each is a string that may contain formating information.  They have access to
an object called info.  

When there is no match, info has fields: 
  count 		- This is the nth item matched.
  group_size	- And there are match_count matches in this group.
  filename, filesize, time (in msecs).
When there is a match, info has additional fields:
  group_index	- This is the nth match for this item 
  puid, formatname, signaturename, 
  mimetype (the first one).

Note that the reported time is in milliseconds for an entire group.  If you sum the times and
there is only one match per group, then the total is correct.

The defaults for Fido 0.8.3 are:
  printmatch: 
  "OK,{info.time},{info.puid},{info.formatname},{info.signaturename},{info.filesize},\"{info.filename}\"\n"
  printnomatch:
  "KO,{info.time},,,,{info.filesize},\"{info.filename}\"\n"

It can be useful to provide an empty string for either, for example to ignore all failed matches,
or all successful ones.
     
Note that a newline needs to be added to the end of the string using \n.

Examples
--------

Identify all files in the current directory and below, sending output
into file-info.csv
   python -m fido.run -r . > file-info.csv

Do the same as above, but also look inside of zip or tar files:
   python -m fido.run -r -z . > file-info.csv

Do the same as above, but also use file extensions, if a file cannot
be identified through patterns
   python -m fido.run -r -z -ext . > file-info.csv

Take input from a list of files:
   ls > files.txt
   python -m fido.run -f files.txt

Take input from a pipe:
   find . -type f | python -m fido.run -f -
     
Only show files that could not be identified.
	python -m fido.run -r -matchprintf "" .

Exclude a specific format from consideration:
   python -m fido.run -r -z -ext -exclude "fmt/134" . > file-info.csv
