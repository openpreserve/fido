<H1>TENINO SERIES</H1>
<BR>
The Tenino series consists of moderately deep to cemented pan, well drained soils formed in glacial till.  Tenino soils are on terminal moraines and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.<P>
<B>TAXONOMIC CLASS:</B> Coarse-loamy, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Dystroxerepts<P>
<B>TYPICAL PEDON:</B> Tenino gravelly ashy loam - under a coniferous forest on a 5 percent slope at an elevation of 350 feet.  When described the soil was dry to 21 inches and moist below. (Colors are for  moist soil unless otherwise stated.)<P>
<b>A1</b>--0 to 5 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) gravelly ashy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent pebbles; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)<P>
<b>A2</b>--5 to 11 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) gravelly ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) dry; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent pebbles; many fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)<P>
<b>Bw1</b>--11 to 21 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly ashy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent pebbles; common fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 13 inches thick)<P>
<b>Bw2</b>--21 to 36 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly ashy sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent pebbles; common fine and medium roots; many very fine pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (12 to 17 inches thick)<P>
<b>2Bsm</b>--36 to 40 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; massive; very hard, very firm, 50 percent  pebbles; fine roots in cracks; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)<P>
<b>2C</b>--40 to 60 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam; light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; single grain; loose, 70 percent pebbles; few very fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.6).<P>
<B>TYPE LOCATION:</B>  Thurston County, Washington; about 2 miles northwest of Littlerock; 800 feet east, 400 feet north of southwest corner of sec.  27, T. 17 N., R. 3 W.<P>
<B>RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:</B>  Depth to 2Bsm horizon ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 51 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Coarse fragments  in the control section average from 20 to 35 percent including up to 10 percent cobbles.<P>
The A horizon has hues of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR moist and 10YR or 7.5YR dry,  value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.<P>
The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y value of 3 through 5 and 6 or 7 dry, chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.<P>
The 2Bsm horizon averages from 50 to 80 percent pebbles.<P>
The 2C horizon is extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  It has 60 to 90 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.<P>
<B>COMPETING SERIES:</B>  These are the 
<A HREF="http://ortho.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/H/HARSTINE.html">Harstine</A> and 
<A HREF="http://ortho.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/P/POULSBO.html">Poulsbo</A> soils.  Harstine soils have 50 to 75 percent sand in the control section and a cemented pan extending to greater than 60 inches.  Poulsbo soils have a Cd horizon with less than 35 percent coarse fragments.<P>
<B>GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:</B>  Tenino soils are on terminal and recessional glacial moraines at elevations of 50 to 400 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. These soils formed in glacial till over glacial outwash.  Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F; average July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The frost-free season (32 degrees F) is 150 to 200 days.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches.<P>
<B>GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:</B>  These are the 
<A HREF="http://ortho.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/A/ALDERWOOD.html">Alderwood</A>, 
<A HREF="http://ortho.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/C/CATHCART.html">Cathcart</A> and 
<A HREF="http://ortho.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/E/EVERETT.html">Everett</A> soils.  Alderwood soils are loamy-skeletal and are dense and compact for many feet below the duripan.  Cathcart soils are medial, deep and formed in glacial drift, volcanic ash, sandstone and siltstone.  Everett soils are sandy-skeletal.<P>
<B>DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:</B>  Well drained, slow to medium runoff, moderate permeability above the cemented pan, very slow in the pan and very rapid below.<P>
<B>USE AND VEGETATION:</B>  Woodland,hay, pasture and homesites.  Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, red alder and western redcedar with an understory of salal, vine maple, western swordfern and western brackenfern.<P>
<B>DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:</B>  Central western Washington.  Series is of moderate extent.<P>
<B>MLRA OFFICE RESPONSIBLE:</B> Portland, Oregon<P>
<B>SERIES ESTABLISHED:</B>  Thurston County, Washington, 1949.<P>
<B>REMARKS:</B> Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  Classification revised 1/2000 from mixed, mesic Vitrandic Durochrepts to isotic, mesic Vitrandic Dystroxerepts based on changes to Soil Taxonomy.<P>
Diagnostic horizons and features include:<P>
Ochric epipedon<BR>
Cambic horizon - from 11 to 36 inches<BR>
Cemented pan - from 36 to 40 inches and cemented with aluminum, iron, and organic matter.<BR>
Vitrandic subgroup feature - from 0 to 36 inches with estimated properties of &gt; 5 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid-oxalate Al plus 1/2 Fe.<BR>
Particle-size control section - from 10 to 36 inches.<P>
Depths to diagnostic horizons and features noted in range of characteristics are measured from the to of the first mineral horizon.<P>
