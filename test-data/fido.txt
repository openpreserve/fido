 NOTICE  OF  PROPOSED  RULE  MAKING 
 Adopted:  May  4,  2005  Released:  May  6,  2005 
 Comment  Date:  June  27,  2005  Reply  Comment  Date:  July  12,  2005 


 By  the  Assistant  Chief,  Audio  Division,  Media  Bureau: 
 1.  The  Audio  Division  has  before  it  a  Petition  for  Rule  Making  filed  by  Dr.  Sandra  L.  Woodruff  (“  Petitioner”),  proposing  the  allotment  of  Channel  229C3  to  Tenino,  Washington,  as  its  first  local 
 aural  transmission  service.  Petitioner  states  that  she  will  file  an  application  for  Channel  229C3  at  Tenino,  if  allotted.  1 


 2.  Petitioner  states  that  Tenino,  Washington  is  an  incorporated  city  with  a  2000  U.  S.  Census  population  of  1,447  persons.  Tenino  is  governed  by  a  five  member  city  council  under  an  elected  mayor 
 according  to  Petitioner.  Additionally,  Tenino  has  its  own  post  office  and  zip  code  of  98589.  Petitioner  also  states  that  Tenino  has  an  active  business  community,  a  number  of  local  churches,  the  Tenino  School  District 
 402,  and  is  served  by  the  Tenino/  Bucoda  Police  Department  and  the  Tenino  Fire  Department. 
 3.  The  proposal  to  allot  Channel  229C3  at  Tenino  warrants  consideration  because  it  would  provide  first  local  service  to  the  community.  2  A  staff  engineering  analysis  indicates  that  Channel  229C3  can 
 be  allotted  to  Tenino  consistent  with  the  minimum  distance  separation  requirements  of  the  Commission’s  rules  at  reference  coordinates  located  at  46-  51-  22  North  Latitude  and  122-  52-  30  West  Longitude  with  a  site 
 restriction  of  1.9  kilometers  (1.1  miles)  west  of  the  community.  Because  the  reference  coordinates  for  Channel  229C3  at  Tenino,  Washington  are  located  within  320  kilometers  (200  miles)  of  the  U.  S.-  Canadian 
 border,  Canadian  concurrence  has  been  requested. 


 1  We  note  that  subsequent  to  the  December  14,  2004,  filing  of  the  instant  proposal,  an  Auction  37  application  for  a 
 new  construction  permit  on  Channel  228A  at  Ocean  Shores,  Washington  (File  No.  BNPH-  20041228AAT)  was  filed  on  December  28,  2004,  and  granted  on  March  25,  2005  pursuant  to  47  C.  F.  R.  §  73.215. 


 2  The  proposed  Tenino  allotment  is  short  spaced  to  Channel  229C,  Station  KPDQ-  FM  at  Portland,  Oregon.  Channel 
 230C2  was  substituted  for  Channel  299C,  and  KPDQ-  FM’s  license  was  modified  to  reflect  the  channel  change,  pursuant  to  a  Report  and  Order  issued  in  MB  Docket  02-  136.  See  Arlington,  et  al.,  19  FCC  Rcd  12803  (MB  2004). 


 Although  that  Report  and  Order  has  become  effective,  the  decision  in  that  docket  is  not  yet  final  because  an  Application  for  Review  and  a  Petition  for  Reconsideration  remain  pending.  We  caution  parties  that  if  we  grant  the 
 instant  proposal  to  allot  Channel  229C3  at  Tenino,  Washington,  the  grant  will  be  subject  to  the  final  outcome  of  MB  Docket  No.  02-  136.  See  Auburn,  Alabama,  et  al.,  18  FCC  Rcd  10333  (MB  2003).

 herein.  In  particular,  we  note  that  a  showing  of  continuing  interest  is  required  in  paragraph  2  of  the  Appendix  before  a  channel  will  be  allotted. 


 6.  Pursuant  to  Sections  1.415  and  1.419,  4  interested  parties  may  file  comments  on  or  before  June  27,  2005,  and  reply  comments  on  or  before  July  12,  2005,  and  are  advised  to  read  the  Appendix  for

 7.  Parties  must  file  an  original  and  four  copies  of  each  filing.  Filings  can  be  sent  by  hand  or  messenger  delivery,  by  commercial  overnight  courier,  or  by  first-  class  or  overnight  U.  S.  Postal  Service

 Hampton  Drive,  Capitol  Heights,  MD  20743.  U.  S.  Postal  Service  first-  class  mail,  Express  Mail,  and  Priority  Mail  should  be  addressed  to  445  12  th  Street,  SW,  Washington,  D.  C.  20554.  All  filings  must  be 
 addressed  to  Marlene  H.  Dortch,  Secretary,  Federal  Communications  Commission,  Office  of  the  Secretary.  Any  filing  that  is  not  addressed  to  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  will  be  treated  as  filed  on 
 the  day  it  is  received  in  the  Office  of  the  Secretary.  See  47  C.  F.  R.  Section  1.7.  Accordingly,  failure  to  follow  the  specified  requirements  may  result  in  the  treatment  of  a  filing  as  untimely. 


 8.  The  Commission  has  determined  that  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act  of  1980  do  not  apply  to  a  rule  making  proceeding  to  amend  the  FM  Table  of  Allotments,  Section 
 73.202(  b).  5  This  document  does  not  contain  proposed  information  collection  requirements  subject  to  the  Paperwork  Reduction  Act  of  1995,  Public  Law  104-  13.  In  addition,  therefore,  it  does  not  contain  any 
 proposed  information  collection  burden  “for  small  business  concerns  with  fewer  than  25  employees,”

 1.  Pursuant  to  authority  found  in  47  U.  S.  C.  Sections  4(  i),  5(  c)(  1),  303(  g)  and  (r),  and  307(  b),  and  47  C.  F.  R.  Sections  0.61,  0.204(  b)  and  0.283,  IT  IS  PROPOSED  TO  AMEND  the  FM  Table 
 of  Allotments,  47  C.  F.  R.  Section  73.202(  b),  as  set  forth  in  the  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule  Making  to  which  this  Appendix  is  attached. 


 2.  Showings  Required.  Comments  are  invited  on  the  proposal(  s)  discussed  in  the  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule  Making  to  which  this  Appendix  is  attached.  Proponent(  s)  will  be  expected  to  answer 
 whatever  questions  are  presented  in  initial  comments.  The  proponent  of  a  proposed  allotment  is  also  expected  to  file  comments  even  if  it  only  resubmits  or  incorporates  by  reference  its  former  pleadings.  It 
 should  also  restate  its  present  intention  to  apply  for  the  channel  if  it  is  allotted  and,  if  authorized,  to  build  a  station  promptly.  Failure  to  file  may  lead  to  denial  of  the  request. 


 3.  Cut-  off  protection.  The  following  procedures  will  govern  the  consideration  of  filings  in  this  proceeding: 
 (a)  Counterproposals  advanced  in  this  proceeding  itself  will  be  considered,  if  advanced  in  initial  comments,  so  that  parties  may  comment  on  them  in  reply  comments.  They  will  not  be 
 considered  if  advanced  in  reply  comments  (see  47  C.  F.  R.  Section  1.420(  d).) 
 (b)  Petitions  for  rule  making  which  conflict  with  the  proposals  in  this  Notice  will  be  considered  as  comments  in  the  proceeding,  and  Public  Notice  to  this  effect  will  be  given  as  long 
 as  they  are  filed  before  the  date  for  filing  initial  comments  herein.  If  they  are  filed  later  than  that,  they  will  not  be  considered  in  connection  with  the  decision  in  this  docket. 


 (c)  The  filing  of  a  counterproposal  may  lead  the  Commission  to  allot  a  different  channel  than  was  requested  for  any  of  the  communities  involved. 
 4.  Comments  and  Reply  Comments;  service.  Pursuant  to  applicable  procedures  set  out  in  47  C.  F.  R.  Sections  1.415  and  1.420,  interested  parties  may  file  comments  and  reply  comments  on  or

 written  comments,  reply  comments,  or  other  appropriate  pleadings.  The  person  filing  the  comments  shall  serve  comments  on  the  petitioners.  Reply  comments  shall  be  served  on  the  person(  s)  who  filed  comments 
 to  which  the  reply  is  directed.  A  certificate  of  service  shall  accompany  such  comments  and  reply  comments  (see  47  C.  F.  R.  Section  1.420(  a),  (b)  and  (c).)  Comments  should  be  filed  with  the  Secretary,
